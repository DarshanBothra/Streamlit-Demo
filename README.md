## üìä Data Visualization Demo

The file [`dataviz.py`](https://github.com/DarshanBothra/Streamlit-Demo/blob/main/dataviz.py) demonstrates:

- Loading a CSV file ([`movies.csv`](https://github.com/DarshanBothra/Streamlit-Demo/blob/main/movies.csv)) into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Displaying the dataset within the Streamlit app.
- Generating random bar and line charts for visualization.

## üß© Basic Streamlit Functionality and Page Navigation

- [`main.py`](https://github.com/DarshanBothra/Streamlit-Demo/blob/main/main.py) showcases basic Streamlit operations such as reading inputs, writing outputs, and handling button clicks.
- The [`pages`](https://github.com/DarshanBothra/Streamlit-Demo/tree/main/pages) directory contains:
  - [`1_home.py`](https://github.com/DarshanBothra/Streamlit-Demo/blob/main/pages/1_home.py)
  - [`2_dashboard.py`](https://github.com/DarshanBothra/Streamlit-Demo/blob/main/pages/2_dashboard.py)  
These files demonstrate how to implement multi-page navigation within a Streamlit application.
